Under the guidance of Pippin Barr, I'm approaching [DiSalvo](http://carldisalvo.com/)'s Adversarial Design applied to the context of (online) Game Design. Adversarial Design is a reference to Chantal Mouffe's notion of [Agonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonism).

"Agonism is a condition of disagreement and confrontationâ€”a condition of contestation and dissensus. Those who espouse an agonistic approach to democracy encourage contestation and dissensus as fundamental to democracy." (DiSalvo, 2015)

"To claim that adversarial design does the work of agonism means that designed objects can function to prompt recognition of political issues and relations, express dissensus, and enable contestational claims and arguments." (DiSalvo, 2015)

DiSalvo's Adversarial Design consequently aims to approach design as a strategy to **embody Agonism**. In other words, Adversarial Design aims to do  **- through design strategies and dynamics -** "the work of Agonism".

In the [Master's Thesis Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wq8xWYlTZ7X-dRnMwLcv9QUrnFLvfM-mthPl4srZJ48/edit?usp=sharing) I'm currently working on, I investigating internet from three different yet related *tensions* inherent to its materiality. I laid down these thoughts through this sort of manifesto:

#1 - "On the one hand, the internet appears as an immaterial system, characterised by light minimal user interfaces and clouds of data. On the hand, **internet is operated by a series of (wired) physical components: ranging from undersea cables, modems and routers**."

#2 - "On the one hand, internet appears as a silent stack of protocols, performing their actions transparently. On the other hand, **internet originated from sounds/sonic agencies; noisy telephone lines, using screeching modems in order toestablish connections**."

#3 - "On the one hand, the internet appears as an immediate system of data transmission, characterized by a perfect data flow. On the other hand, **internet is punctuated by delays, failures and other frequent protocol anomalies**."

TO COME : Internet's materiality vs ISP's marketing strategies.
TO COME: Reveal Internet's Materiality?
