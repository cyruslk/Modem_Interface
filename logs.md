OK! This is happening in the context of the Independent Study I'm doing with [Pippin Barr,](http://www.pippinbarr.com/) PhD. Pippin Barr is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Design and Computation Arts](http://www.concordia.ca/finearts/design.html) at [Concordia University](http://www.concordia.ca/), Montréal. 

Under the guidance of Pippin Barr, I'm approaching [DiSalvo](http://carldisalvo.com/)'s Adversarial Design applied to the context of (online) Game Design. Adversarial Design is a reference to Chantal Mouffe's notion of [Agonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonism).

Following DiSalvo: "Agonism is a condition of disagreement and confrontation—a condition of contestation and dissensus. Those who espouse an agonistic approach to democracy encourage contestation and dissensus as fundamental to democracy." (DiSalvo, 2015)

DiSalvo's Adversarial Design aims to approach design as a strategy to **embody Agonism in design**. In other words, Adversarial Design aims to do the do **- through design strategies and dynamics -** "the work of Agonism".

"To claim that adversarial design does the work of agonism means that designed objects can function to prompt recognition of political issues and relations, express dissensus, and enable contestational claims and arguments." (DiSalvo, 2015)

In the [Master's Thesis Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wq8xWYlTZ7X-dRnMwLcv9QUrnFLvfM-mthPl4srZJ48/edit?usp=sharing) I'm currently working on, I approached internet from three different yet related tensions inherent to its materiality:

"On the one hand, the internet appears as an immaterial system, characterised by light minimal user interfaces and clouds of data. On the hand, the internet is operated by a series of wired physical components: ranging from undersea cables, modems and routers.

On the one hand, the internet appears as a silent stack of protocols, performing their actions transparently. On the other hand, the internet originated from noisy telephone lines, using screeching modems to establish connections.

On the one hand, the internet appears as an immediate system of data transmission, characterized by a perfect data flow. On the other hand, the internet is punctuated by delays, failures and other protocol anomalies."

This idea that internet is a messy, physical, odd, weird, delayed, irregular infrastructure highly interests me. 

TO COME : Internet's materiality vs ISP's marketing strategies.
TO COME: Reveal Internet's Materiality?
